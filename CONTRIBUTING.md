## Contributing
If you have any contributions to the default blocklist feel free to shoot me an email at apps@debijl.xyz or make a pull request here. If you would like to make your own blocklist, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Fdebijl/FakeNewsBlocker/wiki/Blocklist-syntax) on the proper syntax for making a blocklist.

If you would like to translate Fake News Blocker to your own language, feel free to put in a pull request! You can copy the English base-file from /_locales/en and add your translations to that file - descriptions are available inline. Once you are done, rename the 'en' folder to your own [two-letter language code](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable) and submit a pull request.
