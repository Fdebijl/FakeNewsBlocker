Fake News Blocker will no longer be supported. This repository will remain public in the interest of full disclosure, but should no longer be considered to be representative of my work.

## Summary
Fake News Blocker uses a crowdsourced list of so called 'fake news' websites that publish falsified news with either monetary intent or the intent to spread misinformation. If you happen upon one of these sites with this plugin installed you'll get a notification alerting you that the current page has been known to publish fake news. 

Under the settings menu users can opt to block out the website entirely instead of showing a notification, or include their own blocklists.
